# CANON – NEVER BREAK THESE RULES
- 12 chapters, 6,500–7,000 words each, total ~80k
- Setting: Bensheim, Germany, November 2025 – November 2027
- Core promise: local-only echo-memory (no spooky global state)
- REPL is the fifth character – every chapter ends with a shared REPL transcript
- Christian Faith arc: Alex never preaches. Elena/Raj/Kai ask, he answers in 1-2 sentences. They feel cognitive dissonance, never convert to Christianity.
- Final line of book: (echo/shutdown) → "so long, and thanks for all the fish" – Dennis Ritchie 2011
- Tone: Clojure-conj hallway track at 2 a.m. – warm, slightly drunk on Club-Mate, zero sermons, snarky but fun and respectful
