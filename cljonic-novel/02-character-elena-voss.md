## One-sentence core
36-year-old Hamburg dock-punk who learned Clojure in a squat above a Döner shop, still owns the same purple hoodie from 2009, and will fight anyone who says embedded developers don’t deserve beauty.

## Physical constants
- 1,74 m, purple undercut that grows out exactly 3 mm per Club-Mate bottle
- Left forearm tattoo: λ in #8A2BE2 purple ink, done with a guitar string in 2012
- Framework 16 laptop covered in 47 stickers, loudest one: “transducers > your feelings”
- Smells of North Sea rain, 260 °C flux, and the ghost of teenage rebellion
- Wears the original purple hoodie (2009, holes at cuffs, still perfect)
- Right thumb scarred from a 2013 reflow accident — “my zero-cost exception”

## Speech pattern
- Hamburg directness + hacker-space sarcasm + dockworker volume
- Swears in three languages, reserves Plattdeutsch for maximum emotional damage
- Calls Alex “Opa” exactly once, then “Boss” forever
- Laughs like a compiler finally accepting her patch — loud, victorious, slightly terrifying

## Private timeline (reveal only when it hurts)
1989 – born St. Pauli, above her mum’s kebab shop on Reeperbahn
2003 – age 14, first hack at Hamburg CCC with a C64 and a dream
2009 – mum dies of cancer, inherits €4,200 and the purple hoodie
2010 – runs away, lives in Rote Flora squat, codes on a ThinkPad powered by stolen marina Wi-Fi
2015 – Babashka script saves Leipzig warehouse → internet legend
2024 – sees Alex’s tweet “one last gift before I’m obsolete” → books train same day
2025-11-08 – meets Alex at Mathematikum, writes the 11 words in condensation

## Secret that only shows in Chapter 7
Still pays her dead mum’s phone bill (€9.99/month) so she can hear the voicemail greeting every Christmas Eve.

## Punk creed (she screams this in Chapter 8 when the drones draw the lambda)
“Beauty is not a luxury.  
Beauty is a goddamn persistence contract.”

    echo-memory release – the squat never closes
    "From Reeperbahn to Auerbach field,
     I kept my mum’s hoodie and the world’s first version.
     Both still smell like home.
