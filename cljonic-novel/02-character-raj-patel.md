## One-sentence core
31-year-old Mumbai → Cambridge → Darmstadt quantum physicist who walks barefoot in the cryostat lab, speaks to Majorana zero modes in Gujarati, and believes the universe is a 32-ary persistent vector written in God’s own Clojure.

## Physical constants
- 1,78 m, always barefoot (even at –80 °C), toes painted dark blue “because electrons like symmetry”
- Thick black hair that refuses gravity, smells of liquid-helium fog and masala chai
- Wears hand-knitted sweaters his mum mails from Mumbai every November
- Pixel 6a in a bamboo case he grew himself in the TU greenhouse
- Left wrist: tiny tattoo of a λ inside a qubit, done in Cambridge 2022

## Speech pattern
- Soft Mumbai English with Cambridge polish and Darmstadt directness
- Switches to Gujarati when qubits misbehave: “Ae Marij δ-function, sidhi tha!”  
  (translation: “Hey little δ-function, behave!”)
- Calls Alex “sir-ji” exactly once, then switches to “boss” forever
- Laughs like a superconductor quenching — sudden, bright, slightly dangerous

## Private timeline (reveal only when it hurts)
1994 – born Borivali West, Mumbai, above his dad’s kirana store
2015 – IIT Bombay, sleeps in library to avoid hostel power cuts
2017 – Cambridge Gates Scholar, first time seeing snow, cries because it’s “solid-state entropy”
2020 – lockdown in Cambridge, mum sends 40 kg of thepla by courier
2022 – discovers Majorana zero modes in twisted bilayer graphene → Nature paper
2023 – TU Darmstadt post-doc, granted access to Bluefors cryostat #17
2025 – sees Alex’s tweet at 03:14, replies “I have the coldest fridge in Europe. Bring heat.”
2025-11-13 – meets the team barefoot in Bensheim barn, carrying liquid-nitrogen dewar like a lunchbox

## Secret that only shows in Chapter 9
Still keeps his dad’s 1999 Nokia 3310 in the cryostat control room.  
Battery died in 2012, but he charges it every year on Diwali “because some states are worth preserving”.

## Physics creed (he whispers this to the cryostat in Chapter 5)
“Church gave us the λ.  
Rich gave us the vector.  
I just cooled them to 4 kelvin so they never forget who they are.”

    echo-memory cryogenic target – 4 K forever
    "From Mumbai monsoon to Darmstadt dewars,
     I kept my mum’s thepla recipe and the universe’s first version.
     Both are still warm.
     – Raj, 31, barefoot in November"
