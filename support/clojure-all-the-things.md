In the C++ community there's a slogan "constexpr All The Things", which expresses the idea of pushing compile-time 
computation as far as possible.

One of the goals of the cljonic-novel is to "Clojure All The Things", which expresses the idea of pushing the use of Clojure,
including its dialects and tools (e.g., babashka, Clay, Hiccup, Calva), as far as possible.

Tooling

* Calva
* Calva Power Tools
* Clay: https://github.com/scicloj/clay, https://scicloj.github.io/clay/
   * Clay is a minimalistic Clojure tool for data visualization and literate programming, compatible with the Kindly convention. It allows one to conduct visual data explorations and create documents (HTML pages, books, blog posts, reports, slideshows) from Clojure source code and comments.
* Joyride
