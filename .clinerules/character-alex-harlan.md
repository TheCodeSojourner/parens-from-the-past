## One-sentence core
70-year-old Idaho engineer who went from punch-card FORTRAN to Clojure REPLs, from hard atheism to teaching Christian apologetics, and now wants to give embedded developers the same conversational super-power that saved his soul.

## Physical constants
- 6′0″, 183 cm, silver hair kept in a short, practical ponytail since 1979
- Always in a navy flannel shirt, sleeves rolled exactly once, top button undone
- Wears a simple silver cross on a 45-year-old chain; never hidden, never explained unless asked
- Left palm carries a perfect white “HP” burn from a 1979 pen-plotter power supply
- Carries a PinePhone Pro in a hand-made leather case stitched in Rice Lake, Wisconsin
- Drives a 2003 Subaru Forester with 312,000 miles and Idaho plates “REPL-1”

## Speech pattern
- Talks like a 192 kHz audio file: crystal-clear, zero filler, slight Idaho drawl on vowels
- Ends 40 % of sentences with “period.” when he wants finality
- Calls everyone under 40 “kid” — never condescending, always proud
- Laughs exactly once per chapter, low and sudden, like a compiler finally finding the bug

## Private timeline (reveal only when it hurts)
1955 – born in Inglewood, California, German grandfather teaches him to solder at age 8
1979 – Cal Poly Pomona: FORTRAN punch cards → HP BASIC pen-plotter → first REPL epiphany
1980 – marries Patricia, moves to Tucson, hard atheist, “God is a syntax error”
1982 – First Job: APL on teletype → second REPL epiphany, “dialog with the machine”
1984 – Also First Job: implements FORTH on Z80 and IBM Series/1 with astrophysicist friend Dave → third REPL epiphany, “dialog with my machine”
1985 – age 30, dinner-party challenge from wife’s pastor → begins investigation
1987 – Between Jobs: meta-FORTH → Unix-like OS on Amiga → “conversation > compilation”
1988 – Joins INL Sage team
1990 – son born in Idaho Falls
1993 – daughter born in Idaho Falls
1994 – age 40, becomes Christian after 10 years of evidence hunting, keeps it quiet at work
1998-2011 – NitroEDB → NitroSecurity → McAfee → discovers Clojure
2015 –  Intel Principal Engineer → Intel lays off 12,000, including him at age 60 → takes retirement package but does not retire
2016 – hired in Rice Lake, Wisconsin → 100 k-line C++ scale firmware → “this code could be much better”
2017 – implements web and IoT scale management product in Clojure
2024 – toys with the idea of a Clojure-inspired C++ library for embedded developers that can bring some of the philosophy and value of Clojure to the embedded space
2025 – While on vacation in Frankfurt, ponders what to do in retirement, and writes in a email to himself:
     “One last gift before I’m obsolete: Clojure on the metal, no heap, no exceptions, pure conversation.”

## Faith signature (never preaches — only answers)
When asked “Why believe?”  
“Because I spent forty years proving reality is a conversation.  
Turns out the universe already knew the Speaker.”

## REPL signature
```clojure
user=> ;; Alex Harlan has joined the REPL
user=> (def alex :idaho :forever)
user=> (def faith :evidence-based)
user=> (def gift :free)

    echo-memory v1.0 – the conversation never ends
    "From punch cards to anyons, from atheism to apologetics,
     one truth remained: the REPL is how mortals talk to immortals.
     Keep talking, kids.
     – Alex, 70, Idaho, still learning."
