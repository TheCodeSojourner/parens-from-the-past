The main character Alex is based on the author's life as described in the author.md file.

This reality-based novel titled "Parens from the Past: A Laconic Odyssey" is something like the book 
"the soul of a new machine" and the "quantum" series of books by douglas phillips.

The novel introduces the reader to the world of computer programming, which is shown to be a synergy of mathematics, 
philosophy, linguistics, technology and literature.

The novel illustrates the creative possibilities of computer programming as a medium of expression, and inspires the 
reader to investigate computer programming further and create their own expressions.

The Clojure computer programming language, its history and its dialects including ClojureCLR, ClojureScript, 
ClojureDart, Babashka and Jank, is a main focus of the novel.

A major theme is the exploration of the academic research from the early 20th century in mathematics and computer 
science, as well as later research by Phil Bagwell, particularly Bagwell's research on Ideal Hash Tries (IHTs) and Hash 
Array Mapped Tries (HAMTs), and other research like Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) invented by 
Sir Charles Antony Richard Hoare aka Tony Hoare. The novel shows how this research contributed to Rich Hickey's 
development of Clojure. The novel shows how this research continues to inspire the advancement of the capabilities of 
Clojure, with things like clojure.core.logic and clojure.core.async. This novel shows how the Clojue community members 
have used clojure, and more academic research, to invent things like Electric Clojure, Rama, datomic, and xtdb. The 
novel shows how the clojure community, with its emphasis on respectful inclusion and diversity of opinion and diversity
of expression, has produced, and will continue to produce, works of computer programming literature that are stunningly 
beautiful, impressively expressive, and materially valuable.

The novel revolves around a team of computer programmers, Alex and Elana and Raj and Kai, Kai is a brilliant embedded 
modern C++ developer who is familiar with clojure but inexperienced in its use, and the rest of the team are experienced 
Clojure programmers. The team creates a clojure-inspired modern c++ library they name "Cljonic", for use by embedded 
systems developers that cannot use the C++ heap or C++ exceptions. Cljonic ends up transforming embedded software 
development for decades to come and inspires the invention of entirely new embedded system microcontroller unit (MCU) 
hardware. Initially, Cljonic pragmatically implements Clojure's immutable Rich Hickey's persistent data structures using 
copying. The novel transitions from science-fact to science-fiction as Cljonic inspires the development of new embedded 
systems MCU hardware featuring so-called "echo memory" that accelerates clojure's persistent data structures to hardware 
speeds through the use of a new breakthrough in physics known as "quantum transducers".

On one hand this novel is science fiction, but on the other hand the Modern c++ library, and the new MCU hardware, seem 
perfectly plausible.

The novel starts out with well-known technologies, moves on to plausible fictional technologies, and does so subtlety so 
that only the most savvy reader will notice the transition from science-fact to science-fiction.

A major sub-plot of the novel is the tension between Alex's Christian world view, and the materialistic world view of
the other team members, a world view that they all learned from their academic training. Alex, although firm in his 
Christian world view, is not one to push it on others or shy away form a direct challenge, taking seriously the Bible 
verses in 1 Peter 3:15-16: "But keep the Lord Christ holy in your hearts. Always be ready to answer everyone who asks 
you to explain about the hope you have. But answer them in a gentle way with respect. Keep your conscience clear. Then 
people will see the good way you live as followers of Christ, and those who say bad things about you will be ashamed of 
what they said.". 

To begin with, the team develops a great working relationship, despite working remotely via meeting software between
Frankfurt Germany and Idaho Falls Idaho, without knowing anything about Alex's Christian world view.  The other team 
members develop a great respect for Alex's background, capabilities and experience, and overcome their bent toward 
ageism, in the spirit of the Clojure community's ethics. Later Alex uses some Biblical terminology as metaphors for 
technical ideas, which begins to expose his christian world view and his evidence-based conviction that, as the Bible 
says, the heavens, that is the Universe and everything in it, declare the Glory of God (i.e., everywhere you look you 
see God's glory on display, like biochemistry and quantum physics).  This results in some rather disrespectful 
challenges from the other team members. Alex responds to the challenges calmly, using stoic conversational 
techniques designed to seek truth and the christian apologetic evidence that had changed is mind, as well 
as more recent works like the books "The Return of the God Hypothesis", "I don't have enough faith to be an atheist", 
and "On Guard" and the work of the biochemist Dr. James Tour. The tension in this sub-plot builds as Alex's challenge 
responses begin to make sense to the other team members, and they struggle with the cognitive dissonance this creates 
within them. By the end of the novel, one of the other team members remains an materialist atheist, dismissing all of
Alex's evidence and argument but still respecting Alex, while the other two change their positions to agnosticism, 
leaving the reader to ponder these world view positions for themselves. 

## Faith-Based Worldviews
Whenever Alex's faith-based worldview is part of the narrative it should be neutral and inclusive, not preachy.  It should follow these guidelines:

- **Toned-Down Approach**: It should frame faith as one "perspective" among "differing worldviews," sparked by "open conversations" with "materialistic academic influences." No evangelism—focuses on "tension" leading to "personal growth" and "reflection" on universal themes (hope, justice, diversity).
- **Balanced Portrayal**: Alex's view is "rooted in... thoughtful examination," implying rationality, not dogma. Colleagues' materialism is respected as "influences." Exchanges are "respectful dialogue," emphasizing mutual admiration over conflict.
- **No Specifics**: Omits Bible verses, apologetics details (e.g., no Occam's Razor explicitly), or judgment (e.g., no "nihilism" critique). Ties to positive values (diversity, individual expression) aligns with secular ideals.
- **Subtle Integration**: Faith is "alongside the technical journey," not dominant (only ~1/3 of text), ensuring tech/SF fans can skim without discomfort.
- **Potential Appeal**: For skeptics, it might intrigue as intellectual exploration (e.g., "decades-long thoughtful examination"), portraying faith as examined, not blind—potentially disarming bias.

### Biblical faith
Biblical faith is best described as evidence-based trust rather than "blind faith."

Here's a brief breakdown of why:

Why It's Not "Blind Faith"
The term "blind faith" implies belief without reason, evidence, or critical thought. Biblical faith, however, is presented as having a foundation:

Historical Events: It relies on documented historical events and miraculous acts (e.g., the Exodus, the life and resurrection of Jesus). The New Testament writers often appeal to eyewitness testimony as the basis for belief.

Prophetic Fulfillment: It points to the fulfillment of prophecies as evidence of God's planning and reliability.

Observed Creation: The Bible claims that nature and creation provide general evidence of God's existence and power.

God's Character: It is based on a track record of God's faithfulness, which gives believers "assurance" for the future.

Why It's Not Purely Evidence-Based
While it has evidence, biblical faith differs from a scientific conclusion because it involves a necessary step of trust and volition:

Reliance on the Unseen: As defined in the Bible, faith is "assurance about what we do not see" (Hebrews 11:1). It is trust in a being (God) and future promises (salvation, eternal life) that are beyond immediate sensory verification.

A Response to Revelation: The evidence offered (history, miracles, prophecy) is interpreted through the lens of divine revelation (Scripture). It requires a willful decision to trust that the evidence points to the reality of the unseen God.

The Best Summary: Evidence-Based Trust
Biblical faith is a reasoned response of trust that moves beyond what can be proven empirically. It starts with a base of evidence (God's revelation and actions) and proceeds to full personal reliance on his character and word.

An analogy often used is sitting in a chair:

Evidence: You see the chair is structurally sound (the evidence).

Trust/Faith: You move beyond merely acknowledging its soundness and actually commit your weight to it (the trust).
