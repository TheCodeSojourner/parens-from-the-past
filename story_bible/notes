Computer programming is a synergy of mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, technology and literature.  This sreality-based novel titled "Parens from the Past – A Laconic Odyssey" is something like the book "the soul of a new machine" and the "quantum series of books by douglas phillips that introduces the reader to the world of computer programming, illustrates the creative possibilities of computer programming as a medium of expression and inspires the reader to investigate computer programming further and create their own expressions.  The Clojure computer programming language, and its dialects including ClojureCLR, ClojureScript, ClojureDart, Babashka and Jank, is one of the main foci of the novel. A major plot theme is the discovery and exploration of the academic research from the early 20th century in mathematics and computer science, how this contributed to Rich Hickey's development of Clojure, how it continues to advance the capabilities of Clojure with things like clojure.core.logic and clojure.core.async, how others have continued to invent things like Electric Clojure, Rama, datomic, and xtdb, and how the clojure community has produced works of computer programming literature that are stunningly beautiful, impressively expressive, and materially valuable.  The novel revolves around a team of computer programmers, one of which is familiar with clojure but inexperienced with clojure,  that creates a clojure-inspired c++ library named "Cljonic" for use by embedded systems developers that transforms embedded software development for decades to come and inspires the invention of entirely new embedded system microcontrol units (MCU). On the one hand this novel is science fiction, but on the other hand the c++ library and the new hardware seem perfectly possible to develop.  The novel starts out with well-known technologies, moves on to plausible fictional technologies, and does so subtlety so that only the most savvy reader will notice the transition from science fact to science fiction.

As part of the character development and team tensions, I'd like Alex, a 45-year vetern programmer, to be a Christian, and for there to be occasional tense conversations about the scientific and philosophical support for the existence of God, and the historicity of Jesus and the Gospel, and how a biblical world view leads to hope and peace as opposed to an atheist world view that leads to nihilism and hopelessness.  Also how the growing scientific and philosophical foundations of neodarwinism are crumbling. Part of the tension should be the cognitive dissonance between the respect the team has for Alex, and their atheism.  Their atheism should progress through the novel from hard atheism to soft atheism to agnosticism. Finally, the idea that our modern culture rests upon a christian world view, which is in stark contrast to atheist, marxist, communist world views, that the other team members take the morality of Christianity expressed in our culture for granted, and do not realize that what they call obviously good and right cannot be philosophicallhy supported from an atheist world view.

The Mathematikum in Gießen, Germany. It's located about an hour north of Frankfurt Germany and is the world's first mathematics museum designed for hands-on exploration of mathematical concepts.  The Mathematikum was founded by mathematician Albrecht Beutelspacher and opened in 2002. It features interactive exhibits that make mathematical principles accessible and engaging for visitors of all ages - from puzzles and geometric shapes to probability experiments and optical illusions.

Alex is 70 years old, and lives in Idaho near Yellowstone National Park.  Alex has a German grandfather, and is fond of Germany and Frankfurt. Alex has a bs in mechanical engineering that he received in 1979, who's first introduction to programming was one FORTRAN class using punch cards on a mainframe computer, and did his senior project as an HP Basic program running on a 1970s HP desktop computer that calculated isotherms for a 2D space and drew the 2D space and the isotherms using the attached pen plotter.  At Alex's first job, a major international company, he was able to do internal computer programming classes in the APL language, which amounted to a minor in computer programming. One of Alex's tasks at his first job was implementing the embedded control program for a manufacturing machine that was controlled by an IBM Series/1 minicomputer. Another task was doing the same kind of control program, but on Zilog Z80-based single board computer.  While discussing how to implement these control programs with a coworker, who was an astrophysicist that had worked on the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11 control program for the multiple mirror telescope outside of Tucson Arizona written in the FORTH programming language invented by Charles H. "Chuck" Moore, his coworker suggested that he purchase the BYTE Book titled "Threaded Interpretive Languages" and use it as a guide for implementing a FORTH system on both the Z80 single board computer and the IBM Series/1 minicomputer so that he could write the control programs in the FORTH programming language. Alex and his astrophysicist friend, implemented a meta-FORTH, which is a FORTH that runs on a host computer and is implemented in the assembly lanugage of the host system, and is designed to write FORTH systems for other computers by first writing an assembler in FORTH for the target systems. In Alex's next job, working for a startup company in Tucson Arizona, he used the meta-FORTH to write embedded control software for a series of instrumentation and control hardware that plugged into the original IBM PC, and other compatible computer systems. From that job, Alex moved on to work for the prime contractor of the United States Department of Energy Nuclear research and development laboratory in Idaho Falls Idaho called the Idaho National Laboratory, or INL.  At the INL, Alex worked on a high-performance embedded relational database called Sage with a team of Modula-2 and Ada programmers. The original Sage project started with Modula-2, which is an industrial strength successor to Pascal also invented by Niklaus Wirth.  Modula-2 was chosen over FORTRAN, which was well known by the original Save developers, because of its superior modularity and type characteristics.  Later, the United States Marine Corp, which had been mandated to adopt the Ada programming language created by the United States Department of Defense, not called the United States Department of War, provided funding to translate Sage from Modula-2 into Ada.  The Sage team made the decision to move forward by continuing to develop Sage in Modula-2 and Ada at the same time.  The next job for Alex was to start a startup company with some of his fellow Sage programmers from the INL, and one of his United States Nave Sage users, trying to license Sage for use by commercial and government entities. Eventually this startup ended up embedding Sage in a cyber security appliance product line, and being acquired by a major cyber secutity company. After a few years working at the major cyber secruity company, which is where Alex first encountered and started using Clojure, and attaining the rather rare role of "Principle Engineer", Alex was offered a retirement package, and an invitation to leave the company that could not be refused because the company was doing "workforce realignment".  Then only sixty years old and not ready to retire, Alex got a job at an original equipment manufacturing company (OEM) that manufactured weighing system equipment like load-cell-based scales, scale platforms, and scale indicators that were custom-designed electronic printed circuit boards with microcontroller units (MCU). A suprise to Alex, the typical scale indicator source code was composed of around one hundred thousand lines of C++ code.  It turns out that scale indicators, in order to meet the regulatory requiremens of legal-for-trade weight indicators and function as industrial process controllers, are rather complicated devices.  Having started out doing embedded control systems, Alex now found himself back in the embedded space again, but now with some Clojure experience and an intuition that the Clojure mindest could benefit embedded systems developers too.

Any discussion about God, Jesus and the Gospel should be subtle, and always started by the atheist team members asking questions that may start out snarky and harshly critical of christianity, for example "you don't really belive in God" or "you don't really believe Jesus existed" or "you don't really believe Jesus rose from the dead".

Apologetics should be gentle with no christian and bible terminology.

be sure to introduce the concept of Occam's Razor into the Christian apologetics, and pascal's wager.

The Clojure community has a rightful focus on "underrepresented groups" in the broder computer programming ecosystem. please incorporate into the questions and apologetics the common misunderstandings about Christianity, and what the bible actually teaches about such groups. Also, bring in the reasoning behind Jesus being the only way, and there being only one true God.

I would not say that alex acknowledges Christianity’s failures, rather the failures of christians and christian cultures.  Kind of like not blaming bethoven for a poor performance of his fifth sympnony.

*AI Prompt*

The novel should be engaging, inspirational, and blend technical accuracy with philosophical depth, aiming for approximately 80,000 words. Structure it into 12 chapters as outlined, with each chapter opening with a "paren" vignette (a short historical, philosophical, or clojure code-related insight tied to the themes). Use a tone that's intimate and electric, reminiscent of Tracy Kidder's *The Soul of a New Machine* mixed with Neal Stephenson's speculative style—raw heroism in coding, poetic code interludes, and subtle shifts from factual tech to plausible fiction. Include sidebars with simple Clojure snippets to inspire readers to try programming. Weave in subtle, snark-initiated philosophical debates sparked by the atheist team members, addressing Christian apologetics without dominating the plot. Ensure the story celebrates computer programming as a synergy of mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, technology, and literature, while highlighting the Clojure community's focus on underrepresented groups.

### Novel Title: *Parens from the Past* – A Laconic Odyssey

#### Genre and Core Concept
This is a reality-based science fiction novel that introduces readers to the world of computer programming through the lens of Clojure and its dialects (Clojure JVM, Clojure ALR, ClojureScript, Clojure Dart, Babashka, Jank). It illustrates programming's creative possibilities as a medium of expression and inspires readers to explore it. The plot revolves around a team of programmers creating *Cljonic*, a Clojure-inspired C++ library for embedded systems developers that transforms the field for decades. Start with well-known technologies (e.g., lambda calculus, Lisp roots, real Clojure libraries like core.logic, core.async, Electric Clojure, Rama, Datomic, XTDB), then subtly transition to plausible fictional elements (e.g., *Cljonic*'s "echo persistence" for predictive hardware states, "echo webs" for global device meshes). Only savvy readers should notice the fact-to-fiction shift around Chapter 8.

Key themes:
- Programming as synergy: Math's precision (Church, Turing, Gödel), philosophy's depth (Wittgenstein, Heidegger), linguistics' nuance, technology's grit, literature's poetry (Borges, Joyce).
- Historical exploration: Early 20th-century math/CS (1930s lambda calculus, Turing's 1936 machine, Gödel's 1931 theorems) contributing to Clojure (Hickey's 2007 creation), ongoing advancements, community inventions, and "art" like Quil visuals or Rama streams—beautiful, expressive, valuable.
- Clojure community: Emphasize inclusivity for underrepresented groups (e.g., women, minorities via ClojureBridge workshops, Heart of Clojure grants). Tie this to biblical equality in debates.
- Laconic ethos: Inspired by Rich Hickey's definitional talks; *Cljonic* (Clojure + laconic) embodies "expressing much in few words"—immutable state machines, macro-like templates, async channels in C++.
- Subtle science fiction: *Cljonic* builds on real projects (Jank's native compilation, Ferret's real-time) but extrapolates to transformative tech (zero-cost abstractions, quantum-inspired persistence).

#### Characters and Arcs
- **Alex**: 60s, 45-year programming vet (your avatar), devout Christian. Jaded at start, rediscovers joy through team and history. His faith provides hope/peace; he responds calmly to snarky questions with apologetics. Arc: Mentors team, builds *Cljonic* as legacy.
- **Elena**: Philosopher-linguist, ClojureScript expert. Starts hard atheist, snarky about faith. Arc: Soft atheism (doubts nihilism), to agnosticism (open to design). Represents linguistics/literature synergy.
- **Raj**: Math prodigy, core.logic evangelist. Hard atheist, dismissive. Arc: Soft atheism (neo-Darwinism doubts), to agnosticism. Ties to math history.
- **Kai**: Embedded C++ vet, Jank tinkerer. Hard atheist, brusque. Arc: Soft atheism (historical evidence), to agnosticism. Focuses on tech grit.
- Team Dynamics: Cognitive dissonance—respect Alex's expertise/ethics but reject faith. Atheism evolves through debates. Highlight diversity: Elena as woman in tech, Raj as minority, tying to Clojure's inclusivity.

#### Philosophical Debates and Apologetics
Debates are subtle, always initiated by atheists with snarky questions (e.g., "You don’t really believe in God," "You don’t really believe Jesus existed," "You don’t really believe Jesus rose from the dead"). Emerge in casual moments (coffee breaks, post-REPL). Alex's responses: Laconic, evidence-based, contrasting biblical hope/peace with atheist nihilism/hopelessness. Include:
- Scientific/philosophical support for God (cosmological, teleological, moral arguments; fine-tuning).
- Historicity of Jesus/Gospel (Tacitus, Josephus, Suetonius; early creeds).
- Neo-Darwinism's crumbling foundations (origin of life, macroevolution gaps; calls for new theories).
- Cultural Christianity: Modern morality (dignity, justice) from Christian worldview, taken for granted; contrasts atheist/Marxist/communist views (materialism leading to nihilism).
- Occam's Razor: Simplest explanation for order/morality is one true God, not complex chance/multiverses.
- Pascal's Wager: Rational bet on God—hope if true, little lost if not.
- Common misunderstandings about Christianity: Seen as intolerant, oppressive, bigoted, misogynist, regressive on diversity. Counter with Bible: Equality for underrepresented groups (Galatians 3:28: no distinctions in Christ; Genesis 1:26-27: all in God's image; love neighbor; 1 Corinthians 12: unity in diversity; women's valued roles).
- Exclusivity: One true God (Isaiah 45:5, monotheism's coherence); Jesus only way (John 14:6, unique atonement, fulfilled prophecies, resurrection)—not intolerance, but universal offer.

Tie to Clojure community: Diversity initiatives (e.g., workshops for women/minorities) echo biblical equality, countering misunderstandings.

# Parens from the Past
## A Laconic Odyssey

### Chapter 1: The First Paren

---

**Paren Vignette: Church's Whisper**

*Princeton, 1932. Alonzo Church sits at a desk scattered with notation, seeking a formal system to capture the essence of computation itself. He writes:*

```
λx.x
```

*The lambda. The variable. The body. In three symbols, he captures function—pure, abstract, eternal. Not a machine, but an idea that precedes all machines. The parenthesis becomes his container, his delimiter, his way of saying: within these bounds, transformation occurs.*

*He doesn't know that seventy-five years later, a programmer named Rich Hickey will sit in a room and think: what if we made parentheses visible again? What if we made the structure of thought the structure of code?*

---

The rain came down in sheets across Unter den Linden, and Alex Brenner stood under the awning of the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin, watching tourists scatter like particles in Brownian motion. At sixty-three, he'd seen enough rain to know this one had commitment. It would last.

He should have been home in Portland. Should have been consulting on yet another React migration, collecting his modest fee, watching his grandchildren grow up in pixels on FaceTime. Instead, he'd flown seven thousand miles to spend three days in an archive reading papers that most people thought belonged in museums, not minds.

The library's reading room smelled of old paper and newer anxiety—grad students cramming, researchers racing tenure clocks. Alex had no such pressures. He had time now, and curiosity, and a strange pull toward origins that had intensified as his career approached its own sunset.

He'd requested three boxes from the mathematics collection. The first contained photocopies of Alonzo Church's papers from the 1930s, including the 1936 paper "An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory." Alex had read it before, of course, in graduate school, when it was just required reading. Now he wanted to *feel* it—the moment when functions became first-class, when λ became a symbol that would eventually ripple forward into LISP, into Scheme, into Clojure, into the way he'd spent forty-five years thinking.

He pulled out his laptop—a refurbished ThinkPad running Arch Linux, because some habits die hard—and opened a terminal. The black screen, the blinking cursor. Still, after all these years, a source of comfort. He typed:

```clojure
(defn church-numeral [n]
  (fn [f]
    (fn [x]
      (nth (iterate f x) n))))
```

The encoding of numbers as functions. Church's insight that you didn't need numbers at all—just transformation and succession. Alex smiled. He'd written this same function a hundred times in different languages, but in Clojure it sang.

A voice behind him: "You code in libraries now? Savage."

Alex turned. The woman was maybe thirty-five, sharp-featured, with dark hair pulled into a ruthlessly efficient ponytail. She wore a hoodie that said "λ > π" and carried a messenger bag covered in conference stickers: Strange Loop, Clojure/conj, ICFP.

"Only when the code is historically significant," Alex said.

"Church numerals are never significant. They're intellectual masturbation." But she was smiling. "You're writing that in Clojure."

"Guilty."

"I'm Elena Vasquez. I saw your lambda calculus request in the archive log. We have to request the same carrels when we submit. Are you a historian?"

"Programmer. Was. Am? The tense gets complicated at this age."

She laughed and slid into the chair across from him, uninvited but not unwelcome. "I'm a linguist by training, philosopher by disposition, ClojureScript developer by rent payment. Currently on sabbatical from the University of Barcelona, writing a paper on the computational theory of linguistic meaning. Very exciting for me, very tedious for anyone I explain it to at parties."

"Try me."

For the next hour, as the rain hammered against the high windows, Elena explained her thesis: that the structure of language and the structure of computation were not just analogous but isomorphic at deep levels. That Chomsky's transformational grammars were just poorly disguised lambda abstractions. That the reason Clojure *felt* different from other languages was that it made the linguistic structure visible—the parentheses weren't syntax, they were *semantics*.

Alex listened with the attention of someone who'd spent decades in code and recognized truth when he heard it. When she finished, he said, "You should meet my friend. He's coming to the Clojure meetup tonight."

"There's a Clojure meetup in Berlin?"

"There's a Clojure meetup everywhere. Small language, global reach. We're at a café in Kreuzberg at seven. You should come."

Elena considered this. "Will there be other people citing dead mathematicians?"

"Almost certainly."

"Then I'm in."

---

The café was called *Das Prädikat*, a programmer pun that worked in German and English if you squinted. The back room was reserved for the meetup—fifteen folding chairs, a projector someone had optimistically set up, and a coffee urn that had seen better decades.

Alex arrived early with Elena. Already there: a tall Indian man in his late twenties, typing furiously on a keyboard that sounded expensive, and a shorter, stockier man with a shaved head and the kind of forearm tattoos that suggested either a punk band or embedded systems. Possibly both.

The Indian man looked up. "Alex Brenner? The Alex Brenner? *Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming* Alex Brenner?"

"Peter Norvig wrote that one. I just read it obsessively."

"You wrote the forward to the third edition. I know because I have it memorized. 'Programming is not about machines. It's about clarity of thought made executable.' I literally have that tattooed." He pulled up his sleeve. There it was, in small, precise letters down his inner forearm. "I'm Raj Patel. I'm doing my PhD in computational mathematics at TU Berlin. I'm supposed to be writing my dissertation on constraint satisfaction but instead I'm building a Sudoku solver in core.logic for the twelve-thousandth time."

The stocky man snorted. "Because that's useful." He stood and offered a hand. "Kai Richter. I write firmware for medical devices. C and C++ in the streets, Jank in the sheets. You're the Clojure graybeard everyone keeps talking about on Slack?"

"Depends which Slack."

"The one where someone claimed you once pair-programmed with Rich Hickey."

"That's a vicious rumor. We sat in the same conference room once. He was giving a talk. I was in the audience. Barely counts."

"Still counts," Kai said.

The meetup organizer—a nervous grad student named Jonas—tried to start the official program, but no one was interested. Instead, the five of them clustered around a table, laptops open, and fell into the kind of conversation that only happens when programmers share a common dialect.

Raj showed off his core.logic solver. Elena demonstrated a ClojureScript compiler she'd modified to output more readable JavaScript for her students. Kai pulled up Jank—the native Clojure implementation that compiled to machine code—and showed them a REPL running on a Raspberry Pi at 60 frames per second.

And Alex, feeling something he hadn't felt in years—maybe joy, maybe just recognition—pulled up a side project he'd been noodling on. A small embedded Clojure interpreter, written in C++, designed to run on microcontrollers.

"Why?" Kai asked.

"Because I'm old and I miss when LISP ran on everything. Because these tiny computers are everywhere now and they deserve better than Arduino's dialect of C. Because—" He paused. "Because I think there's something there. A way of thinking that embedded systems need but don't know they need yet."

Raj leaned in. "Show me the macro system."

"It doesn't have one yet. Barely has a reader. But look—" Alex pulled up the code. Clean, simple, targeting the subset of Clojure that could compile to tiny machines. Immutable data structures. Persistent vectors. Lazy sequences. "I'm calling it a proof of concept, but really it's an act of faith."

"Faith," Elena said, with an edge Alex noted but didn't comment on. "Interesting word choice for a programming project."

"Metaphorical faith. The belief that this approach will bear fruit even when the path isn't clear."

"Still a religious framing," she said. "You didn't strike me as the type."

The room's energy shifted, subtle but present. Kai's eyes flicked between them. Raj suddenly found his keyboard fascinating.

Alex met her gaze. "I'm Christian, if that's what you're asking. Has been for most of my life. Doesn't come up much in code reviews."

Elena's smile was sharp. "You don't *really* believe in God, though. Not literally. You're too smart for that. It's cultural, right? A framework?"

The challenge was clear. Alex had been here before—dozens of times, over decades, in different forms. He could deflect. He could joke. He could change the subject.

Instead, he said, quietly: "I believe that the universe is not an accident. That the order we discover in mathematics, the beauty we find in well-written code, the moral intuitions that make us recoil from cruelty—these point to something beyond matter. And yes, I believe that something has a character, a will, a purpose. You can call that God or you can call it something else, but the phenomenon demands explanation."

"Confirmation bias," Elena said. "Pattern-seeking in noise."

"Maybe. Or maybe pattern-finding in signal. How do you distinguish them?"

Raj interjected, uncomfortable: "We should probably focus on code, yeah? Before Jonas throws us out for philosophizing."

But Elena wasn't done. "Okay, different angle. You code in Clojure. You love functional programming. You appreciate elegance, simplicity, the Occam's Razor of clean abstractions. And yet you accept the baroque complexity of Christian theology? Three-in-one divinity, virgin births, resurrections? Where's the parsimony?"

Alex took a sip of terrible coffee, buying time not to think but to judge the room. Kai was watching with interest. Raj looked pained. Jonas had given up on the official agenda entirely.

"Occam's Razor," Alex said, "tells us to prefer the simplest explanation that fits the data. Not the *easiest* explanation. Not the one that requires the least. The cosmos exists—complex, ordered, fine-tuned for life. Consciousness exists—subjective experience that no materialist account has successfully reduced. Morality exists—not just preferences but actual oughts, things that are genuinely wrong regardless of opinion. The simplest explanation that covers all that data is not 'matter + time + chance.' It's an intentional designer."

"Or a multiverse," Elena countered. "Infinite universes, one happens to have the right constants."

"That's not simpler. That's *infinitely* more complex. You're multiplying entities to avoid one entity."

"But at least those entities follow natural law."

"So does God, if He authored natural law."

"Convenient."

"Parsimonious."

They stared at each other. Then Elena laughed. "Okay. You're better at this than I expected. Most Christians I argue with lead with 'the Bible says.'"

"The Bible's a source text. Not an argument. You wouldn't start a math proof with 'Euclid says.' You'd start with axioms and build from there."

"And your axioms?"

"That existence requires explanation. That consciousness suggests mind. That morality suggests source. Work backward from there, and you get—at minimum—theism. The specific details of Christianity? That's a longer conversation."

"One I'd like to have," Elena said, surprising him. "Not because I'll agree. But because you're not an idiot, and I want to know how someone who thinks like you do ends up where you are. It's a data point."

"Fair enough."

Kai cleared his throat. "So. About this embedded Clojure thing. Are we actually doing this? Because I've got six weeks between contracts, and I'm bored out of my skull. If you're serious, I'm in."

Alex blinked. "You want to help?"

"I want to *lead*, but I'll settle for helping. You've got the vision. I've got the C++ chops. Raj has the math. Elena has the language theory. We could actually build something."

"Build what, exactly?" Jonas asked, finally finding his voice.

Alex looked at the four of them—young, brilliant, diverse in every way that mattered. The kind of team that the Clojure community had worked so hard to cultivate. Women in tech like Elena, minorities like Raj, all the underrepresented groups that ClojureBridge and Heart of Clojure grants had fought to include. Not because of tokenism, but because diverse perspectives made better software.

"A library," Alex said. "Clojure-inspired C++. For embedded systems. We bring immutability, persistent data structures, clean concurrency to the world of firmware. We make microcontrollers that think in S-expressions."

"You're insane," Raj said.

"Probably."

"When do we start?"

"Tonight?" Alex pulled up a blank repo on GitHub. "We need a name first. Something that captures what we're doing. Clojure meets embedded. Clojure meets C++. Something... laconic. Expressing much in few words."

Elena's eyes lit up. "Cljonic. CL from Clojure, onic from electronic, laconic as subtext. Three meanings in seven letters."

Kai typed it. "Cljonic. I like it. Domain's available. GitHub org is free. Let's claim it before someone else thinks of this insane idea."

And so they did.

Want to experience the joy of Clojure's simplicity? Try this in an online REPL (like [repl.it](https://replit.com) or [tryclojure.org](https://tryclojure.org)):

```clojure
;; Define a simple function
(defn greet [name]
  (str "Hello, " name "!"))

;; Call it
(greet "World")
;; => "Hello, World!"

;; Now try this - functions are values!
(map greet ["Alice" "Bob" "Charlie"])
;; => ("Hello, Alice!" "Hello, Bob!" "Hello, Charlie!")
```

Notice how functions and data flow together? That's the beginning of thinking in Clojure.

By midnight, they had a manifesto written in a Google Doc that kept crashing because Raj insisted on embedding LaTeX equations. By two AM, they had a basic repository structure and a roadmap that looked laughable in its ambition. By three AM, when the café owner finally kicked them out, they had something more important: momentum.

They stood outside in the cold Berlin night—no longer raining, but damp in that persistent European way—and made plans to reconvene the next day. A hackathon, they decided. All day Saturday. Build the bones of something real.

As the others walked toward the U-Bahn, Elena hung back.

"That thing you said about morality suggesting a source," she said. "I've been thinking about it."

"And?"

"I can't just accept it. You know that, right? I'm not going to convert because of one clever argument in a café."

"I wouldn't expect you to. Conversion isn't about arguments. Arguments just clear away debris."

"Then what is it about?"

Alex considered. "Recognition, maybe. The moment when something you always knew but couldn't articulate suddenly has words. Like the first time you understood recursion—not just the syntax, but the *idea*. You can't argue someone into that. You can only point."

"Point at what?"

"At the structure of things. At the way elegance keeps showing up in math and physics and biology and code. At the fact that you get angry at injustice instead of just noting it as a preference. At the way love and sacrifice and beauty seem to matter in ways that survival and reproduction don't fully explain."

She was quiet for a moment. "You know the Clojure community I'm part of? The one that fights so hard for inclusion, for getting more women and minorities into tech? We do that because we believe in justice. In equality. In human dignity. And we do it—I do it—without needing God to tell me it's right."

"I know," Alex said. "And it's beautiful that you do. But have you ever asked where those concepts come from? Justice. Equality. Dignity. They're not in the atoms. They're not in the DNA. They're not survival strategies—tribalism worked fine for millennia. So where do they originate?"

"Human consensus. Social contract. Empathy."

"Empathy for what? If humans are just matter in motion, why does it matter if some configurations of matter suffer? Why shouldn't the strong dominate the weak? Why shouldn't we optimize for our own genes and ignore everyone else's? Every 'ought' you feel requires a ground. I'm suggesting that ground is a God who made us in His image—all of us, equally, regardless of gender or race or status. That's what Genesis 1:26 claims: *Let us make man in our image.* Not men. Not the powerful. Humanity, plural, imagebearers."

"Cherry-picking verses. The Bible also endorses slavery."

"The Bible *records* slavery as a historical reality and regulates it in ways that undermined its foundation—requiring release of slaves, treating them as persons with rights, ultimately planting seeds that led to abolition. The arc bends toward freedom because the core claim is universal dignity. Paul writes in Galatians 3:28: 'There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.' That's not cherry-picking. That's the central thrust."

She shook her head, but not dismissively. Thoughtfully. "I need to think about this."

"Good. Thinking is what we do best."

"Tomorrow, hackathon. We build Cljonic. No philosophy."

"Deal."

But as he walked back to his hotel, Alex suspected the philosophy would keep leaking in. Code and worldview weren't separate. They never had been. Every architectural decision, every design pattern, every choice about mutability and state and concurrency—they all reflected beliefs about how reality worked, what mattered, what was true.

In his room, he opened his laptop one more time and typed:

```clojure
;; In the beginning was the Lambda
;; And the Lambda was with Code
;; And the Lambda was Code

(defn create [void]
  (assoc void :universe
    (-> {}
        (assoc :math church-numerals)
        (assoc :logic turing-machines)
        (assoc :expression clojure))))
```

He stared at it. Deleted it. Blasphemous? No. Playful. Reverent, even. God as the ultimate abstraction, the ultimate function, the ultimate source.

He'd spent forty-five years learning to see the world through code. Maybe it was time to teach others to see code through the world.

He saved his work and slept, dreaming of parentheses that stretched back to the beginning of thought itself.

*Synopsis*
This reality-based novel titled "Parens from the Past – A Laconic Odyssey" is something like the book "the soul of a new machine" and the "quantum" series of books by douglas phillips.

The novel introduces the reader to the world of computer programming, which is shown to be a synergy of mathematics, philosophy, linguistics, technology and literature.

The novel illustrates the creative possibilities of computer programming as a medium of expression, and inspires the reader to investigate computer programming further and create their own expressions.

The Clojure computer programming language, its history and its dialects including ClojureCLR, ClojureScript, ClojureDart, Babashka and Jank, is a main focus of the novel.

A major theme is the discovery and exploration of the academic research from the early 20th century in mathematics and computer science. The novel shows how this research contributed to Rich Hickey's development of Clojure. The novel shows how this research continues to inspire the advancement of the capabilities of Clojure, with things like clojure.core.logic and clojure.core.async. This novel shows how Clojue community members have used clojure, academic research, to invent things like Electric Clojure, Rama, datomic, and xtdb. The novel shows how the clojure community, with its emphasis on respectful inclusion and diversity of opinion, has produced, and will continue to produce, works of computer programming literature that are stunningly beautiful, impressively expressive, and materially valuable.

The novel revolves around a team of computer programmers, one of which is familiar with clojure but inexperienced with clojure and the rest that are experienced Clojure programmers. The team creates a clojure-inspired modern c++ library named "Cljonic", for use by embedded systems developers that cannot use the C++ heap or C++ exceptions. Cljonic ends up transforming embedded software development for decades to come and inspires the invention of entirely new embedded system microcontroller unit (MCU) hardware. Initially, Cljonic pragmatically implements Clojure's immutable persistent data structures using copying . The novel transitions from science-fact to science-fiction as Cljonic inspires the development of new embedded systems MCU hardware featuring "echo memory" that accelerates clojure's persistent data structures to hardware speeds.

On one hand this novel is science fiction, but on the other hand the Modern c++ library, and the new MCU hardware, seem perfectly plausible.

The novel starts out with well-known technologies, moves on to plausible fictional technologies, and does so subtlety so that only the most savvy reader will notice the transition from science-fact to science-fiction.
